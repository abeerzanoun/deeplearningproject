# Deep Learning Project
This repository will contain the code and resources for a research project focused on detecting lung diseases in chest X-rays leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) integrated with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The project aims to develop a robust and interpretable model for accurate identification of diverse lung pathologies.
